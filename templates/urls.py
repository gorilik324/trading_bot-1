Sure! Here's the updated urls.py file with the views imported from views.py and the URLs for the login, start bot, and stop bot views:

python
Copy code
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', views.login_view, name='login'),
    path('start-bot/', views.start_bot_view, name='start_bot'),
    path('stop-bot/', views.stop_bot_view, name='stop_bot'),
    # Add additional URLs for any other views that you may have
    # Example: path('some-view/', views.some_view, name='some_view'),
]
Make sure to update your views.py file with the appropriate view functions for the login, start bot, and stop bot views as per your requirements. Also, update your forms.py file with the additional fields for the StartBotForm as needed
