Based on the implementation provided in the previous responses, the manage.py file, which is used as Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks, should be updated as follows:

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks."""
import os
import sys

def main():
    """Run administrative tasks."""
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'trading_bot.settings')  # Updated to match your Django project name
    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError(
            "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
            "available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you "
            "forget to activate a virtual environment?"
        ) from exc
    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Note that the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE should be updated to match the name of your Django project, which appears to be trading_bot based on the provided code. This setting tells Django which settings module to use for the project.

Additionally, if you need to integrate the arbitrage trading logic into your Django project, you would need to import the relevant modules and instantiate the ArbitrageBot class with the appropriate parameters based on your desired settings. You can then call the run() method to start the execution of the arbitrage bot. The specific integration steps would depend on your overall project structure and requirements.
