This appears to be a Django template for a login form that extends a base template (base.html). The {% block content %} tag defines a content block that can be overridden in the base template, and the login form is rendered within this block.

The form uses the POST method and includes a CSRF token using the {% csrf_token %} template tag for security. It includes two input fields for the username and password, which are rendered using the form.username and form.password template variables respectively. The for attribute of the <label> elements uses the auto_id property of the form fields, which automatically generates a unique ID for each form field.

Finally, a submit button with the label "Login" is included in the form, and the form data will be submitted to the server for processing when the button is clicked.
