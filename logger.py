In this updated code, we have added logging and error handling. We create a logger object with a specified name, set its level to DEBUG, and add a file handler to log messages to a file. We also specify a log format that includes the timestamp, logger name, log level, and log message.

Inside the main() function, we wrap the code that may raise an exception in a try-except block. If an exception occurs, the logger.exception() method is called with the exception object, which automatically captures the traceback information and logs it with the specified log format. This allows us to capture detailed information about the error and its context in the log file for later analysis.

You can customize the logging level, log format, and log file location according to your needs. It's also a good practice to use different logging levels for different types of messages, such as DEBUG for debugging information, INFO for informative messages, WARNING for warnings, ERROR for errors, and CRITICAL for critical errors. This allows you to control the amount of logging output and prioritize the severity of the messages.

Additionally, you can implement error handling using try-except blocks to catch specific exceptions and handle them gracefully. In the example provided, an except block is used to catch exceptions and log them using the logger.exception() method. You can customize the error handling logic inside the except block, such as displaying an error message, sending a notification, or taking any other appropriate action based on the type of exception caught.

By implementing logging and error handling in your code, you can capture and analyze errors and exceptions, and gain insights into the performance and behavior of your trading bot, which can help you in troubleshooting and improving the reliability of your code.
