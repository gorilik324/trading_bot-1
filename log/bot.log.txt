To update the bot.log file inside the log folder in the main trading_bot project, you can use the Python logging module. Here's an example of how you can modify the code in the strategies.py file to implement logging:
import logging
import os

# Create the log folder if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists('log'):
    os.makedirs('log')

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Define file handler and set formatter
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('log/bot.log')
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s')
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add file handler to logger
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

def strategy_function():
    try:
        # Your strategy logic here
        # ...
        # If an exception occurs, it will be caught and logged
        result = 1 / 0  # Example of an exception
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error and its context
        logger.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
In the updated code, we have added logging configuration to create a log file named bot.log inside the log folder in the main trading_bot project. We set the logging level to DEBUG so that all log messages, including errors, will be logged. We defined a file handler that writes log messages to the bot.log file with a specific format, and added it to the logger. Then, inside your strategy function, you can catch any exceptions that occur and log them using the logger.error() method with the exc_info=True argument, which allows logging the traceback information of the exception. This will log any errors that occur during the execution of your strategy function into the bot.log file, allowing you to track and debug them.
